# GHOM - GitHub Organization Manager - WIP!!!

Ghom is a tool to manage your GitHub organisation.
Currently work in progress.

## How to use

In any case you need to change the settings in your organization to allow changes from actions. Head over to <https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions>, scroll down to _Workflow permissions_ and select __Read and write permissions__. Otherwise github actions cannot change settings on your organization.

### Automated (recommended)

1. Create a fresh new GitHub organization. You may use ghom also on an existing org, but I will not guarantee for flawless integration. In any case: Use with caution. 
2. Create a repository containing a `ghom.yaml` file.
3. Create a workflow like shown [here](.github/workflows/ghom_workflow.yml.example) in the same repository.
4. Trigger the workflow it by either merging a PR to main (containing a change in `ghom.yaml`) or by manual execution.

### Manual

```sh
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER=ghomtest
export INPUT_GHOM_CONFIG=ghom.yaml
export INPUT_GHOM_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export INPUT_GHOM_DRY=False
python3 -m ghom.main
```

## FAQ

Q: How to deal with private repositories?\
A: Look [here](docs/private_repositories.md)

Q: Why do you have to use a GHP token?\
A: A GitHub app would require a running server. I could provide one, but this would have the drawback, that the rate limit would affect all users simultaniously. Either we "gain" more possible requests than needed. Or a user with a humoungus organization size installs the app and will block the app for all users...

Q: How to deal with my large organization that is too large to fit into 5000 api requests per hour?\
A: Switch back to manual adjustment or split the ghom file into multiple parts. The principle is basically the same as if you would use [private repositories](docs/private_repositories.md). If you have another (elegant) solution, let me know!

Q: Why do repositories have to be initialized with the default README.md file?\
A: Otherwise branch protections cannot be set.

Q: Why is the code so redundant?\
A: To keep it simple. If you have a solution, that removes redundant code while keeping it easy to maintain and understand, feel free to create a pull request.

Q: Why is there no script to generate a `ghom.yaml` file from an existing org?\
A: I had no interest in creating one yet. Chances are low that I find the motivation in the future :)

## Known issues

Branch protection rules are a bit flanky. You can only delete them, if default rules are set. Leaving them empty would result in keeping the current rules.

If you create a new team, the owner of the organization will be added automatically to this team. Therefore you'll see first the creation of the and and second the deletion of a team member. This behavior is due to GitHub internal handeling of these API requests and cannot be changed.
